<h4>2. Required Software</h4>Some software components need to be installed before using this instrument driver. The minimum versions of these components are listed below, and can be downloaded from the Download Site.

VISA 4.0
LeCroy VICP VISA Passport (for Ethernet communication; not required for GPIB operation)
<b>The LeCroy VICP VISA Passport can be obtained from the <a href ="http://www.lecroy.com/tm/Library/Software/LabView/LabViewDrivers.asp?menuid=8">Software Utilities</a> section of LeCroy's website.</b>

Note: 
VISA has additional software requirements. For example, unless you are using a serial interface, NI-VISA requires that NI-488.2 and/or NI-VXI
be installed on your system. Check with VISA help for additional support software and hardware requirements.

<h4>3. Installation Instructions</h4>The LeCroy Wave Series driver should be installed under your LabVIEW installations instr.lib folder, in a folder called LeCroy Wave Series. This is most easily done by
opening the lecroy_wave_series.zip file using Winzip. From the Winzip main window, select Extract, and in the subsequent window find and select your LabVIEW
instr.lib folder. The lecroy_wave_series.zip archive includes path information beginning with the LeCroy Wave Series folder, so there is no need to create this folder
yourself. Make sure that the options "All files/folders in archive" and "Use folder names" are selected, and then click the Extract button.
Within the LeCroy Wave Series directory you can find the menu files and VI libraries that make up the instrument driver. 
The menu files allow you to view the instrument driver VIs from the Functions palette. The VI libraries contain the instrument driver VIs. This Readme file will also 
be extracted to the LeCroy Wave Series folder.
<h4>4. Using the Instrument Driver</h4>To verify communication with your instrument and test a typical programmatic instrument operation, you should first open the Example VIs contained within the instrument driver. 
To find the examples, open up the project file, which is located in the path ..instr.lib/LeCroy Wave Series/LeCroy Wave Series.lvproj

Look over each of the controls and set  them appropriately. Generally, with the exception of the address field, the defaults for most controls will be sufficient for your first run. 
You will need to set the instrument resource name appropriately. After running the VI, check to see that reasonable data was returned and an error was not reported in the error cluster.

After you have verified basic communication with your instrument, you might want to customize instrument control for your needs. If your application needs are similar to the Getting 
Started or Example VI, the simplest means of creating a customized VI is to save a copy of the Getting Started or Example VI by selecting Save As from the File menu. You can then modify 
this example to meet your specific needs.
For more details, reference the <i>LabVIEW Help</i> under <i>Help » VI, Function, & How-To Help</i>.
<h4>5. Known Issues</h4>To report issues or provide feedback about this instrument driver,  <a href="http://www.ni.com/en-us/support.html">please contact technical support</a>.
This driver supports most of the functionality common to all supported instrument series.  It does not support all functionality specific to a particular instrument series.
This driver supports all TeledyneLeCroy scopes that use the Windows Operating System. Scopes with more than 4 channels will require a small modification to accommodate the added channel numbers.

<b>REV 3.1 08/11/2008</b>
Modified by Alan Blankman (LeCroy Corporation)
This version includes no critical fixes, but includes both major and minor fixes and improvements as well as several useful new subVIs.

New VIs:
lcwave Transfer File: Transfers a file from the oscilloscope's hard drive to a remote PC
lcwave Get Screenshot: Grabs a screenshot and transfers the image data to the remote PC in a variety of image formats
lcwave Configure Measure Mode: Configures the measurement mode to either My Measure, Standard Horizontal or Standard Vertical.  
lcwave Configure Input Path: Selects whether to use the A or B input. (Only needed for certain WP, SDA and DDA 7Zi models.)
lcwave Acquire and Read MyMeasurements: New example

Revised VIs:
lcwave Read Waveform Measurement (Px Statistics): Corrected parsing for non-standard parameters
lcwave Read Waveform Measurement (Standard): Improved parsing to avoid potential Scan from String error
lcwave Read: Removed TCP/IP case, since users should use the VICP passport for TCP/IP connections instead of NI's TCPIP passport, which isn't supported
lcwave Write: Removed TCP/IP case, since users should use the VICP passport for TCP/IP connections instead of NI's TCPIP passport, which isn't supported
lcwave decode IDN query response: Added models WE100H, WS24XS, M series and new WavePro, SDA and DDA 7Zi models
lcwave Configure Channel: Added coupling options AC and DC to support probes, moved VDIV ahead of OFST for ruggedness
lcwave Configure Coupling: Added couping options AC and DC to support probes
lcwave Fetch Waveform: Added Custom Source ID to allow readback of traces with names not included in combo-box
lcwave Read Single Waveform: Added Custom Source ID to allow readback of traces with names not included in combo-box
lcwave Read Multiple Waveforms: Added Custom Source ID to allow readback of traces with names not included in combo-box
lcwave Fetch All Segments: Revised to increase speed by not requiring separate reads for each segment.
lcwave Configure Trigger (polymorphic): Modified subVI's for proper handling of Ext and Ext10 sources. See VI descriptions and block diagram comments for more information. Users are recommended *not* to use the "External" selection, but instead to use "Ext" or "Ext10" explicitly.
lcwave Transfer Selected Waveform: Fix instructions to read "VICP::" instead of "VICP:"
lcwave Fetch Max Min Waveform: Changed T0 to be "0"
lcwave decode trigtime: Modified to work with both Hi/Lo and Lo/Ho comm_orders
lcwave Get Descriptor: Modified to use new version of decode trigtime	
lcwave Get Waveform: Added Custom Source ID,  inserted "+1" so that the VI also returns the last point (which happens to be off grid.)
lcwave Sequence Acquisition: Removed autosetup, set Initialize options to False
lcwave Acquire Waveform: Added instructions
lcwave Acquire Waveform In Loop.vi: Added options to make a Reset and Autosetup optional, added instructions
lcwave Initialize: Reduced timeout to 10 seconds from 30 seconds, which was unnecessarily long for Initializing.

<b>REV 3.2 08/10/2012</b>
Modified by Leonard Brown (LeCroy Corporation)
This version includes no critical fixes, but includes minor fixes and improvements.

Revised VIs:
File: Transfer External To Ext Or Ext10.vi
Changes: Changed the check for the User Data Value to look for the WaveSurfer value of 1 instead of a 0. The zero value is not assigned to all scopes and the WaveSurfer is the only one that has a different value.

File: Decode IDN query response.vi
Change: Re-wrote VI to only look for “LECROY” and older WaveSurfer 4xx series scopes to ensure the device is in fact a LeCroy scope and to set the value for the older scopes external input if detected.

File: Configure Channel Preprocessing.vi
Change: Removed Check for scope type to determine if Enhanced Resolution is available. Enhanced Resolution is now available on all scopes.
 
<b>REV 3.2 Oct 12 2018</b>
Modified by Alan Blankman (Teledyne LeCroy)
This version includes one minor fix to a VIs connections.

Revised VIs:
File: Configure Input.vi
Change: Connected terminals to the Channel and Path controls.

Revised Palette:
The Configure Palette now includes all public VIs in the Configure folder.

<b>REV 3.3 April 2019</b>
Modified by Alan Blankman (Teledyne LeCroy)
This version includes two fixes, one to core a VI that affects users who connect via USBTMC, and one for reading out measurement statistics

Revised VIs:
File: Write.vi
Change: Enhanced VI to handle USBTMC connections differently. When the VISA connection uses USBTMC, the VI will send data to the instrument in 50K chunks. The reason for this change is that the VISA write 
cannot handle passing the complete buffer in a single call to Write.vi. Note that this issue is only encountered when sending large amounts of data to the oscilloscope, such as when using the PNSU command to transfer a panel setup file.

File: Read Waveform Measurement (Px Statistics).vi
This VI is one selection for the Read Waveform Measurement polymorphic VI. Due to historical reasons, it was not returning results when cursors were also enabled
